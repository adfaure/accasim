Job dispatchers
===============

The job dispatcher has the key role of deciding when (scheduler) and on which resources (allocator) to execute the individual 
requests by ensuring high system performance and Quality of Service (QoS), such as high utilization of resources and high throughput.

Some dispatchers can be defined with the :doc:`available schedulers and allocators in the AccaSim library. <accasim_disp>`
